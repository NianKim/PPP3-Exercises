Review Chapter 09

[1] Why is I/O tricky for a programmer?
Due to the added layer of abstraction of Device drivers doing the heavy lifting, we:
	1. set up I/O streams from data sources to destinations
	2. read and write from those streams of bytes/characters

[2] What does the notation << hex do?

The istream does this from the other operation
in the library <fstream> << is a function for type streams and essentially:
- name the output file
- open the output file for writing or create a new file of that name
- write out our objects
- close it 

[3] What are hexadecimal numbers used for in computer science? Why?

[4] Name some of the options you may want to implement for formatting integer output.

[5] What is a manipulator?

[6] What is the default output format for floating-point values?
scientific notation

[7] Explain what setprecision() and setw() do.

[8] Which of the following manipulators do not “stick”: hex, scientific, setprecision(), setw()?

[9] In format(), how do you specify where an argument is placed on output?

[10] Give two examples where a stringstream can be useful.

[11] When would you prefer line-oriented input to type-specific input?

[12] What does isalnum(c) do?

[13] When dealing with input and output, how is the variety of devices dealt with in most modern computers?

[14] What, fundamentally, does an istream do?
The istream:
	- recieves those sequences via buffer (delay) data structure from a source
	- turns character sequences into values of various types

[15] What, fundamentally, does an ostream do?
The ostream:
	- turns values of various types into character sequences
	- sends those sequences via buffer (delay) data structure to a destination

[16] What, fundamentally, is a file?

[17] What is a file format?

[18] Name four different types of devices that can require I/O for a program.


[19] What are the four steps for reading a file?
	[1] Know its name
	[2] Open it (for reading)
	[3] Read in the characters
	[4] Close it (though that is typically done implicitly)

[20] What are the four steps for writing a file?
	[1] Name it
	[2] Open it (for writing) or create a new file of that name
	[3] Write out our objects
	[4] Close it (though that is typically done implicitly)

[21] Name and define the four stream states.
good()	the operations have succeeded
eof()	hit the end of input ("end-of-file")
fail()	something unexpected happened (e.g. type error) may be able to recover
bad()	something unexpected and serious happened (e.g. a disk read error) cant recover

[22] Discuss how the following input problems can be resolved:
	The user typing an out-of-range value
	Getting no value (end-of-file)	
	The user typing something of the wrong type
	There are three options, while the first one should be reserved for small programs we do not intend to share or use for more than 2 hours. we can:
	- ignore the problem
	-throw an exception or handle the problem in the code doing the read
	usually when the input needs to be validated, throwing an exception is the way to go, because iostream is not have any underlying logic within it
	if we reach end of file, there really isn't an elegant solution between the latter two, so we need to ask ourselves, what we need from the program in that context specifically
		
[23] In what way is input usually harder than output?
we need to deal with the following three problems:
	-The user typing an out-of-range value
	-getting to no value (end-of-file)
	-the user typing something of the wrong type

[24] In what way is output usually harder than input?
you need to account for the different possible types

[25] Why do we (often) want to separate input and output from computation?
	Reading values
	Prompting the user for input
	Writing error messages
	Skipping past “bad” input characters
	Testing the input against a range
[26] What are the two most common uses of the istream member function clear()?
turns the state of cin to cin.good() (sets state flag bits mentioned and clears others)
e.g. ios::failbit or ios::badbit

[27] What are the usual function declarations for << and >> for a user-defined type X?

[28] How do you specify where an argument is inserted into a format string in format()?

[29] What is the notation for bases of decimal values in format()?

[30] How do you specify the precision of floating-point values in format()?
