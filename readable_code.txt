Make the program easy to read so that you have a chance of spotting the bugs:

Comment your code well. That doesn’t simply mean “Add a lot of comments.” You don’t say in English what is better said in code. Rather, you say in the comments – as clearly and briefly as you can – what can’t be said clearly in code:
The name of the program
The purpose of the program
Who wrote this code and when
Version numbers
What complicated code fragments are supposed to do
What the general design ideas are
How the source code is organized
What assumptions are made about inputs
What parts of the code are still missing and what cases are still not handled
References to supporting material (e.g., to a book explaining the algorithms used)
Use meaningful names.
That doesn’t simply mean “Use long names.”
Use a consistent layout of code.
Your IDE tries to help, but it can’t do everything, and you are the one responsible.
The style used in this book is a reasonable starting point.
Break code into small functions, each expressing a logical action.
Try to avoid functions longer than a page or two; most functions will be much shorter.
Avoid complicated code sequences.
Try to avoid nested loops, nested if-statements, complicated conditions, etc. Unfortunately, you sometimes need those, but remember that complicated code is where bugs can most easily hide.
Use library facilities rather than your own code when you can.
A library is likely to be better thought out and better tested than what you could produce as an alternative while busily solving your main problem.
