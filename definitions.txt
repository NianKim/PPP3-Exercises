Chapter 01: 05.01.2026, written off the top of my head
=============================================================
//				starts a single line comment in c++
executable			filetype that is produced by the linker, runs when called by the computer
main				mandatory function in c++. must not be ended with return 0;
<<				indicates the stream of output code
function			consists of 4 parts: return type, name, parameter list and funcition body (expressions)
object code			when source code is compiled, the output is object code
C++				a programming language, built upon C. object-oriented
header file			can be included in programs to provide additional functionality and functions
output				generated by a program/function using given instructions
comment				additional written explanations to increase legibility for human readers, ignored by the compiler
IDE				Integrated develeopment enviornment
program				a set of instructions to a computer, must be very specific and not ambigous
compiler			takes source code and compiles it to object files. useful for debugging, ensures proper syntax
import				modern function (c++20) to use modules, not supported by my setup
source code			the written code in .cpp format on my IDE/text editor before compilation
compile-time			amount of time the compiler takes to translate into object code. can also be a form of error, which usually indicates poor syntax
error				feedback to indicate the program is faulty or not running as intended. Common errors are: compile-time, link-time, run-time or logic
library				collection of programming resources that can be used modularly
statement			different form a declaration, usually inside a function body
cout				common <iostream> expression used to output stands for character output.
linker				connects object files into executable files
module				c++20 feature, is more efficient than #include
#include			widely used way of calling libraries
std				the c++ standard library. one of my goals is to understand it well enough to work with it
command line			aka the terminal, useful to navigating your computer/server and providing a large set of direct instructions
bug				error in a program, can have multiple forms (syntax/sematic)
debugging			fixing errors, can sometimes require a complete overhaul or rethinking of the approach in solving a problem.


Chapter 2:
================================================
object:				is a region of memory with a type
type				specifies what kind of information can be placed in an object
variable			named object
prompt				output/message that encourages user to take action
definition			a statement that introduces a new name and sets aside memory for a variable
name				needed to access an object in memory
values				data items put into variables
initializer			the value after {=} in a definition
