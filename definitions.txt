Chapter 01: 05.01.2026, written off the top of my head

//				starts a single line comment in c++
executable			filetype that is produced by the linker, runs when called by the computer
main				mandatory function in c++. must not be ended with return 0;
<<				indicates the stream of output code
function			consists of 4 parts: return type, name, parameter list and funcition body (expressions)
object code			when source code is compiled, the output is object code
C++				a programming language, built upon C. object-oriented
header file			can be included in programs to provide additional functionality and functions
output				generated by a program/function using given instructions
comment				additional written explanations to increase legibility for human readers, ignored by the compiler
IDE				Integrated develeopment enviornment
program				a set of instructions to a computer, must be very specific and not ambigous
compiler			takes source code and compiles it to object files. useful for debugging, ensures proper syntax
import				modern function (c++20) to use modules, not supported by my setup
source code			the written code in .cpp format on my IDE/text editor before compilation
compile-time			amount of time the compiler takes to translate into object code. can also be a form of error, which usually indicates poor syntax
error				feedback to indicate the program is faulty or not running as intended. Common errors are: compile-time, link-time, run-time or logic
library				collection of programming resources that can be used modularly
statement			different form a declaration, usually inside a function body
cout				common <iostream> expression used to output stands for character output.
linker				connects object files into executable files
module				c++20 feature, is more efficient than #include
#include			widely used way of calling libraries
std				the c++ standard library. one of my goals is to understand it well enough to work with it
command line			aka the terminal, useful to navigating your computer/server and providing a large set of direct instructions
bug				error in a program, can have multiple forms (syntax/sematic)
debugging			fixing errors, can sometimes require a complete overhaul or rethinking of the approach in solving a problem.


Chapter 2:
================================================
object:				region of memory that holds a value with a given type
type				specifies set of possible values and operations in an object
variable			named object
prompt				output/message that encourages user to take action
definition			a statement that introduces a new name and sets aside memory for an object
declaration			statement that gives a name and type to an object.
name				needed to access an object in memory, case sensitive. must start with a letter, consist of letters, digits or underscores, never write a _name starting with an underscore (reserved for implementation and system entities)
values				bits in memory interpreted according to type
initializer			the value after {=} in a definition, always initialize to ensure type safety. Default initialization is guaranteed for string and vector
types				property that restricts permitted operations of name or expression (cppreference)
int				standard integer type, at least 2 bytes, generally 32 bits (4 bytes)
char				1 Byte in width can be signed or unsigned (implementation specific)
bool				size is implementation defined, usually one byte
fundamental types		void, std::nullptr_t (cpp11), integral and floating-point types
standard integer type		char, int, long
modifiers			for integral types (signedness and size) 
signed				default if omitted

short				target type at least 2 bytes
long				target type at least 4 bytes
long long			target type at least 8 bytes
C++ Standard:			1 == sizeof(char) ≤ sizeof(short) ≤ sizeof(int) ≤ sizeof(long) ≤ sizeof(long long)

floating-point types		(float,double, long double)
double				usually 8 bytes in size
special values 			infinity, negative zero, not-a-number NaN
string reading termination	convention: whitespace (space, newline and tab)
				This is super important because it leads to problems in programs (see Chapter02 name_age.cpp) -> TODO
string				stores characters and keeps track of number of elements
useful operations:
concatenation			string 		+
modulo				int		%
increment by n			int, double	+=n	//decrement -=n
add to end			string 		+=
multiply and assign		int, double	*=	//divide /=
greater than or equal		all		>=	// less than or equal <=

keywords			reserved names that generate an error if user defined, defining standard library names like "int string" will cause trouble too
conventional use of variables	x: local variable or parameter, i: loop index
conventional use of CAPITALS	reserved for macros 

type safety			objects used only in accordance to their type rules. generally complete type safety is the ideal.
static type safety		NEVER use language features that cannot be proven type-safe before the program starts executing
