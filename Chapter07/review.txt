[1] What is the difference between a declaration and a definition?
A declaration is a statement that inctroduces a name into a scope. (interface)
	Specifying a type for what is named
	optionally specifying an initializer
	Types of declarations:
		-Variables and constants
		-Functions
		-Namespaces
		-Modules
		-Types (classes and enumerations)
		-Templates
		-Concepts
A definition is a fully specified entity declaration (implementation)
	Sets aside memory
	
[2] How do we syntactically distinguish between a function declaration and a function definition?
A function declaration would be a function without its body

[3] How do we syntactically distinguish between a variable declaration and a variable definition?
A variable declaration would be without assigning the variables value. So in the form:
type name; instead of type name = value;

[4] Why can’t you use the functions in the calculator program from Chapter 5 without declaring one or more of them first?
	Because these functions haven't been declared yet. 
	We first need to define the interfacs to useful facilities to the compiler (usually in the header file)

[5] Is int a; a definition or just a declaration?
This is just a declaration
There is no memory set aside for it yet

[6] Why is it a good idea to initialize variables as they are declared?
because if we end up using the variable before assigning a value it will lead to undefined behaviour [CG: ES.20]
Only defining a variable without initialization should be the exception, not the norm in C++ (no default value, except in the case of string or vector, thanks to the default constructor)

[7] What can a function declaration consist of?
functions are used in C++ to name and represent computations and actions
A function declaration consists of:
	return type (void if we don't want to return a value)
	name
	list of parameters in parentheses (formal arguments)

[8] What is the suffix return type notation, and why might you use it?

[9] What good does indentation do?
Makes nesting apparent

[10] What is the scope of a declaration?
	scope is a region of program text. A name is declared in scope and valid from the point of it's declaration until the end of the scope in which it was declared (e.g. int main(){}
	purpose: keep names local, so they don't interfere with names declared elsewhere
	two incompatible declarations in the same scope are reffered to as a "clash"
	side note: extern keyword states that the following declaration isn't a definition (can be overused for too many global variables) it simply tells us how we can use a name without allocating memory or a function body. using this keyword you can declare as many times as you want
	Every name has to be declared before it is used (except for class members), so sometimes it is necessary to "forward" declare a function in the case of cyclic call chains


[11] What kinds of scope are there? Give an example of each.
There are:
global scope		area of text outside of any other scope
module scope		area of text within a module
namespace scope		a named scope nexted in the global scope or in another namespace
class scope		area of text within a class
local scope		between {...} braces of a block or in a function argument list
statement scope		e.g. in a for-statement

[12] What is the difference between a class scope and local scope?
The class scope is a local scope within the class constructor, creating a nested (local) scope

[13] Why should a programmer minimize the number of global variables?
in order to keep the number and scope of all named entities manageable, one must adhere to locality. Otherwise the declarations clash
Another problem is that we don't know which functions modify our global variables

[14] What is the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference?
functions usually need arguments and often return a result
The way these arguments are specified and passed:
-pass by value:
	gives the function a copy of the value you use as the argument (cost of copying)
-pass by reference: &name
	gives the function the address/reference of the object in memory to be modified
	can be aconvenient shorthand for some object

[15] What is the difference between pass-by-reference and pass-by-const-reference?
-pass-by-const-reference:
	stops the function from modifying its argument by accident (e.g. we only want to write a print() or my_find() function, because copies are unnecessary)
	
[16] What is a swap()?

[17] Would you ever define a function with a vector<double> as a by-value parameter?

[18] Give an example of undefined order of evaluation. Why can undefined order of evaluation be a problem?

[19] What do x&&y and x||y, respectively, mean?
&& logical AND
|| logical OR

[20] Which of the following is standard-conforming C++: functions within functions, functions within classes, classes within classes, classes within functions?
side note: local functions are not legal in C++, use lambdas instead
member classes are most common and useful in complicated classes




[21] What goes into an activation record?

[22] What is a call stack and why do we need one?

[23] What is the purpose of a namespace?

[24] How does a namespace differ from a class?

[25] What is a using declaration?

[26] Why should you avoid using directives in a header?
