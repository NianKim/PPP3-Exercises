# ETH Zurich: Programming Principles and Practice (PPP3)


This repository contains my solutions and exercises for the **Introduction to Programming (C++)** course at ETH Zurich. The curriculum is based on Bjarne Stroustrup's *Programming: Principles and Practice using C++ (3rd Edition)*.

## Overview
As part of the **BSc. Electrical Engineering & IT (D-ITET)** program, these exercises focus on developing a rigorous foundation in modern C++. My goal is to master low-level memory management and object-oriented design, moving from my background in analog hardware toward high-performance digital systems.

## Structure
The repository is organized by chapter and assignment:
- `Chapter_XX/`: Fundamental concepts, variables, and logic.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++20
- **Compiler:** GCC 
- **Concepts Covered:** Type safety, computation, error handling, classes, and generic programming.

## Learning Path
- [x] Basic Syntax and Control Flow
- [x] Vector and Memory Management
- [x] Error Handling and Exceptions
- [ ] Learning Vim keybinds
- [ ] Working with git via terminal
- [ ] Currently focusing on: **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** applications in C++
