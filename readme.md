# ETH Zurich: Programming Principles and Practice (PPP3)

[cite_start]This repository contains my solutions and exercises for the **Introduction to Programming (C++)** course at ETH Zurich[cite: 31, 33]. The curriculum is based on Bjarne Stroustrup's *Programming: Principles and Practice using C++ (3rd Edition)*.

## 🚀 Overview
As part of the **BSc. [cite_start]Electrical Engineering & IT (D-ITET)** program[cite: 29, 30], these exercises focus on developing a rigorous foundation in modern C++. My goal is to master low-level memory management and object-oriented design, moving from my background in analog hardware toward high-performance digital systems.

## 📂 Structure
The repository is organized by chapter and assignment:
- `Chapter_XX/`: Fundamental concepts, variables, and logic.
- [cite_start]`Assignments/`: Specific problem sets assigned by the ETH faculty[cite: 31].
- `Projects/`: More complex implementations involving data structures and algorithms.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++20/23
- **Compiler:** GCC / Clang (via ETH Jupyter/Lab environment)
- **Concepts Covered:** Type safety, computation, error handling, classes, and generic programming.

## 📈 Learning Path
- [x] Basic Syntax and Control Flow
- [x] Vector and Memory Management
- [x] Error Handling and Exceptions
- [ ] Currently focusing on: **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** applications in C++
