[1] What is a computation?
The process of manipulating data to produce a result
[2] What do we mean by inputs and outputs to a computation? Give examples.
input: keyboard, sensors, network
output: screen, audio, network
[3] What are the three requirements a programmer should keep in mind when expressing computations?
correctness, simplicity, efficiency
[4] What does an expression do?
computes the values from a number of operands
[5] What is the difference between a statement and an expression, as described in this chapter?
expressions produce values, statements execute an action and usually end with a semicolon.
[6] What is an lvalue? List the operators that require an lvalue. Why do these operators, and not the others, require an lvalue?
named object on the left side of an assignment operator. ++ or += require an lvalue because they reference and assign an operation to the lvalue. 
[7] What is a constant expression?
an expression that the compiler can evaluate at compile time. the value is kown before the program even runs
[8] What is a literal?
a value written out, like a string or int
[9] What is a symbolic constant and why do we use them?
useful tool when writing programs, usually a mathematical/physical constant (ex. pi = 3.14)
[10] What is a magic constant? Give examples.
a literal number used directly in code where the meaning is not explicitly named. they should be avoided and usually replaced with a well defined, symbolic constant
[11] What are some operators that we can use for integers and floating-point values?
example operators: arithmetic, comparators, in-/decrement
[12] What operators can be used on integers but not on floating-point numbers?
modulo for int
[13] What are some operators that can be used for strings?
concatenation '+', read/write << >>, comparator (output is bool)
[14] When would a programmer prefer a switch-statement to an if-statement?
if the cases can be predefined or one wishes to use many if/else if statements in a row (more efficient)
[15] What are some common problems with switch-statements?
forgetting to Break;
[16] What is the function of each part of the header line in a for-loop, and in what sequence are they executed?
 for(initialization;condition;increment)
first the initiatization is run to define the index. Then the condition is checked. at the end of the loop, the increment takes place (though ++x and x++ are different, but not in a headers behavior)
[17] When should the for-loop be used and when should the while-loop be used?
while-loops are best when you don't know how many times you'll loop. for-loop is best for number of iterations known or tied to a data structure
[18] Describe what the line char foo(int x) means in a function definition.
the function of return type char called foo will take the argument int x
[19] When should you define a separate function for part of a program? List reasons.
not sure about when, except when you want to take an input to synthesise an output a reason is reusability, semantic legibility and overall visual clarity
[20] What can you do to an int that you cannot do to a string?
you can increment an int
[21] What can you do to a string that you cannot do to an int?
you can concatenate a string
[22] What is the index of the third element of a vector?
index is 2, because vectors are 0-indexed
[23] How do you write a for-loop that prints every element of a vector?
for(int i = 0; i < vector.size(); ++i)
[24] What does vector<char> alphabet(26); do?
() in declaration is the number of empty elements to create
[25] Describe what push_back() does to a vector.
vector.push_back(object) takes the object (assuming it is the right type) and adds it to the STACK in a LIFO manner
[26] What does vector’s member size() do?
returns the number of elements in the vector ( not it's data size)
[27] What makes vector so popular/useful?
one of the best data structures for iteration, always stores it's size, always can be accessed with indexes
[28] How do you sort the elements of a vector?
std::sort(v.begin(), v.end());

[A] What is a "Range-for-loop"?
for (int x : v) //for each x in v much safer, because no "off-by-one"
[B] What is the difference between a "Declaration" and a "Definition"?
a definition is a statement that introduces a new name and sets aside memory for an object. a declaration is just a "promise" to the compiler that something exists, does not set aside memory
[C] What happens to a vector's size when you call push_back()?
the size increases
