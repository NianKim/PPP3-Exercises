Review

[1] Why do we use graphics?
	- graphics are useful (e.g. graphing data points)

[2] When do we try not to use graphics?
when we want to save time/resources and the implementation of a ascii-based program is sufficient for our problem

[3] Why is graphics interesting for a programmer?
	- effective pieces of code are immediately obvious, hence rewarding and fun
	- exposure to/reading well-written code is the first step to writing it
	- design examples (patterns, decisions and techniques)
	- object oriented programming design introduction
	- nontrivial and therefore useful to be guided through with a book
goal: to view the direct correspondence between the objects in memory and the images on screen

[4] What is a window?
a window object representing our physical screen is drawn to the screen by a GUI library, with all it's attached graphics objects like lines and circles

[5] In which namespace do we keep our graphics interface classes (our graphics library)?
Graph_lib

[6] What header files do you need to do basic graphics using our graphics library?
	Simple_window.h
	Graph.h

[7] What is the simplest window to use?
	plain "window" instead of simple_window
[8] What is the minimal window?
i don't know I assume its when there's nothing to display and no size defined

[9] What’s a window label?
	The frame of the window (top bar) has a title liek "Canvas"
[10] How do you label a window?
win.set_label("LABEL");

[11] How do screen coordinates work? Window coordinates? Mathematical coordinates?
screen coordinates start in the top left corner of the display and span to the right in the x-axis and down as the y-axis
A window is a rectangular region of the screen devoted to some specific purpose (addressed exactly the same as a screen)

[12] What are examples of simple “shapes” that we can display?
polygons, rectangles, 

[13] What command attaches a shape to a window?
	win.attach(shape_name);

[14] Which basic shape would you use to draw a hexagon?
Using the coordinates of 6 points, you can create a hexagon using Polygon

[15] How do you write text somewhere in a window?
using the text class

[16] How would you put a photo of your best friend in a window (using a program you wrote yourself)?
Image friend {Point{100,50},"friend.jpg"};
win.attach(friend);
win.set_label("My buddy");
win.wait_for_button();

[17] You made a Window object, but nothing appears on your screen. What are some possible reasons for that?
There are no objects attached to the window to display, the windows size is undefined

[18] What library do we use to implement our graphics/GUI interface library? Why don’t we use the operating system directly?
it used to be FTLK, now its QT lib
-program code 
-interface library
-qt library
-c++ std lib
