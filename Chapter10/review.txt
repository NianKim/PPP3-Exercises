Review

[1] Why do we use graphics?
	- graphics are useful (e.g. graphing data points)

[2] When do we try not to use graphics?
when we want to save time/resources and the implementation of a ascii-based program is sufficient for our problem

[3] Why is graphics interesting for a programmer?
	- effective pieces of code are immediately obvious, hence rewarding and fun
	- exposure to/reading well-written code is the first step to writing it
	- design examples (patterns, decisions and techniques)
	- object oriented programming design introduction
	- nontrivial and therefore useful to be guided through with a book
goal: to view the direct correspondence between the objects in memory and the images on screen

[4] What is a window?
a window object representing our physical screen is drawn to the screen by a GUI library, with all it's attached graphics objects like lines and circles

[5] In which namespace do we keep our graphics interface classes (our graphics library)?
Graph_lib

[6] What header files do you need to do basic graphics using our graphics library?

[7] What is the simplest window to use?

[8] What is the minimal window?

[9] What’s a window label?

[10] How do you label a window?

[11] How do screen coordinates work? Window coordinates? Mathematical coordinates?

[12] What are examples of simple “shapes” that we can display?

[13] What command attaches a shape to a window?

[14] Which basic shape would you use to draw a hexagon?

[15] How do you write text somewhere in a window?

[16] How would you put a photo of your best friend in a window (using a program you wrote yourself)?

[17] You made a Window object, but nothing appears on your screen. What are some possible reasons for that?

[18] What library do we use to implement our graphics/GUI interface library? Why don’t we use the operating system directly?
