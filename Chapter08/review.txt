[1] What are the two parts of a class, as described in the chapter?
1. Implementation
2. Interface

[2] What is the difference between the interface and the implementation in a class?
interface: 	users can access directly (public)
implementation:	private part of class declaration accessible indirectly via interface
		used by class members only, usually data or (class members by default)

[3] What are the limitations and problems of the struct Date from §8.4.1?
//a struct is a class where members are public by default
By implementing the date object as three ints (day month year) we add in complication with error-prone assignment (what if we accidentally assign the month value to the day?)
And helper functions (like checking if the date is valid is also difficult)
	=> Which operations would we like for this type
	A public struct cannot enforce an invariant

[4] Why is a constructor used for the Date type instead of an init_day() function?
constructor: a member function with the same name as its class (used for initialization)
The compiler can catch it if we forget to initialize and object of a class if the CONSTRUCTOR requires an argument (it will catch illegal dates)
circular depedency or mutual recursion must be solved with forwqard declaration

[5] What is an invariant? Give examples.
invariant:	a rule for what constitute as a valid state/value
example: roman, Mayan, chinese calendar 
minutes must range from 0 to 59

[6] When should functions be put in the class definition, and when should they be defined outside the class? Why?
notation for outside of class: class_name::member_name
by default the class declaration gets messier if the member functions are defined inside
long and potentially confusing declarations go outside, simple ones go inside 
writing it within has three effects:
	1.	inline: compiler generates code for the function every point of call (ra	ther than using function call intstuctions to use common code
	2.	all uses are recompiled whenever a change is made to the body of inlined function. in contrast, outside only recompiles when class declaration changes
	3.	class definition larger, harder to find the members among definitions

[7] What is a default constructor and when do we need one?
implicitly providing objects of a classs the desired initialization
Deafult means "no arguments"

[8] What is a default member initializer?
An initializer for a class member specified as part of the member declaration is called a default member initializer or an in-class initializer.

[9] When should operator overloading be used in a program? Give a list of operators that you might want to overload (each with a reason). Which ones can you define in C++?
when we have a set of possible values in an enum class and we want to "wrap around" when we reach the boudary. (e.g. when we have a modulo-n counter)
an overloaded operator must have at least one user-defined type as operand, this can only be done with existing c++ operators like +, − *, /, %, [ ], ( ), ˆ, !, &, <, <=, >, and >=.
the most interesting are =, ==, <, ->, [], ()

[10] Why should the public interface to a class be as small as possible?
Because the other programmers will mostly be interested in the public interface.
it is easier to learn, but it must be complete.
less prone to bugs, we want problems to appear at compile time instead of runtime becuase then tests and error-handling code aren't required

[11] What does adding const to a member function do?
immutable values
We want to fundamentally classify operations on a class as modifying or nonmodifying
the compiler will hold us accountable once we define a member function as const 

[12] Why are “helper functions” best placed outside the class definition?
a function that can be used as a free-standing function should be implemented that way, beacuse that way a bug with said function will not corrupt any data of the class object
this makes bugfixing way easier because the range of failed functions is smaller

[13] How does an enum class differ from a “plain” enum?
enum:	user defined type that specifies a set of values as symbolic constants.
we can make sure the enumerations are in scope
enum starts 0-indexed unless the first element is specified otherwise

enum class stops implicit int conversion!
